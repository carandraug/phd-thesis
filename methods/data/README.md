Data sets used in the thesis
============================

The following FACS files were required to draw the FACS histogram at
`figs/facs-stable-cell-lines.svg`.  Due to the absence of libraries for
reading of fcs files, the plots were generated manually in a point and
click software, exported to SVG, opened in Inkscape to change the line
styles to solid, dashed, and dotted, and then saved to PDF.

* `WT_Tube_001.fcs` (456312e7f75f38a7e4968421b1b41a9b) for the histogram of
HeLa cells wild type.

* `H2B 11_Tube_001.fcs` (ac1f23b84e758f033b2ccaa293e51801) for the histogram
of the mixed population expressing H2B EGFP.

* `clone check H2B 2P3_Tube_001.fcs` (ce930978f86f7fb6f453157cc7b2dc4c) for
the histogram of the sorted population.
