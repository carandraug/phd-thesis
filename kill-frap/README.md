Scripts to build thesis figures
===============================

Most of the content of these scripts are adapted pieces of code that is
available elsewhere. The original code should be used for all purposes, but
this gives us finer control to remove the borders caused from deconvolution,
analyze only specific borders, specifify only region of the image, etc.

We use snippets from [FRAPINATOR](https://github.com/af-lab/frapinator)
and [CropReg](https://github.com/af-lab/scripts/blob/master/microscopy/CropReg.m).
