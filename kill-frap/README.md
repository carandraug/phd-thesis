Kill FRAP chapter
=================

Where we talk about our attempt at using FRAP to measure differences in
dynamics between histone mutants, and then explain why it is not possible.

It has the following subdirectories:

* `data` - the raw data.  Almost empty on a fresh clone because the files
  are too large.  Contact David Pinto (author) or Andrew Flaus (PhD
  supervisor) to obtain those files.  SCons will use checksums to make sure
  you got the right files.
* `figs` - figures that are not generated as part of the analysis.
* `results` - figures that are generated as part of the analysis.
* `scripts` - code for the analysis.  Fills `results` with stuff from `data`.
