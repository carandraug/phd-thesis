## The image file 512MB, and even though the images are uint8,
## Magick++ will read it as uint16 or uint32, it it was build with
## that quantum-depth.  There might be other things in play since even
## imfinfo() seems to make it run out of memory.  Anyway, we only need
## part of the frames and image.  So:
##
##   * pick one frame every 17 frames to get a figure showing the cell every
##     25 minutes (time interval is 90 seconds).
##
##   * start on frame 15 (last pre-bleach) and then show frame 16
##     (first post-bleach).  We could automate this by finding max
##     diff between frames.
##
##   * show only 24 frames so it fits nicely in a rectangular montage.
##
##   * The image is too large, show only a small region enough to make
##     the point.

## We only want to show the nuclei moving so we will show their nuclei
## only.  Showing the grayscale image adds too much and the message,
## that cells move even when confluent, is lost.  It would require

## it.
