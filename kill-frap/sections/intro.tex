\section{Introduction}

  \subsection{Histone contribution to nucleosome dynamics}

    The building block of eukaryotic chromatin structure is the nucleosome, comprising
    \SI{147}{\bp} of DNA wrapped around an octamer of two copies of core histones H2A,
    H2B, H3, and H4 \citep{luger1997crystal}.
    Nucleosome core particles are arranged in a linear chain separated by DNA linkers, and
    can be further compacted into higher order chromatin structures.
    The role of chromatin not only achieves DNA compaction,
    but also provides a dynamic complex to mediate access to genetic
    information through its capability to undergo reconfiguration of structure. \addref{Flaus?}

    Local remodelling of chromatin can be achieved
    by changing nucleosome structure or altering its composition.
    This can be performed intrinsically through post-translational modification
    or incorporation of histone variants,
    causing nucleosomes to alter DNA sequence preferences or recruit other proteins.
    Alternatively, chaperones and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes
    can act extrinsically to alter nucleosome structure or position.

  \subsection{Histone SIN mutants}

    The archetype of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling is the SWI/SNF complex
    whose deficiency causes growth defects in yeast.
    This complex was identified independently through screens for
    mating type SWItching \citep{SWI-mutants}
    or Sucrose Non Fermentation \citep{SNF-mutants-original-discovery, SNF-mutants2}.

    A set of mutations were identified that compensate
    for the loss of the SWI/SNF complex
    that are collectively known as SIN mutations because they
    provide SWI/SNF INdependence  \addref{?}.
    A subset of these SIN mutations result in single amino-acid changes to core histones,
    providing a direct link between SWI/SNF and chromatin and suggesting
    that the mutated histone protein residues influence the same 
    nucleosome dynamic pathways leveraged by the enzyme and are therefore
    of major importance in the nucleosome structure.
    This predicted that the stability of SIN mutant containing nucleosomes would be affected in chromatin.
    The hypothesis has been tested \textit{in vitro}
    where it was observed that SIN mutant nucleosomes display higher 
    thermally driven nucleosome sliding mobility \citep{flaus2004sin}
    and that the mutated residues alter histone-DNA contacts in crystal structures \addref{muthurajan2004crystal}.

    However, the effect of histone protein SIN mutants
    in the more complex \textit{in vivo} chromatin environment 
    of mammailian cells has not been demonstrated. This is important to
    validate the functional significance of the residues
    and their implications for the basis of high conservation of 
    histone protein sequences in eukaryotes.

  \subsection{Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching}

    Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an optical technique
    that reveals the dynamics of fluorescently tagged molecules within live cells.
    Tagged molecules inside a small region are irreversibly photobleached by
    a high power focused laser beam and the recovery rate of fluorescence
    in the bleached area is measured. The recovery rate is interpreted as unbleached molecules
    from outside of the region at the time of photobleaching diffusing into the bleached area.
    It is assumed that this fluorescence recovery reflects natural protein movement.

    FRAP can be described by a simple chemical equilibrium:

    \begin{displaymath}
      F + S \overset{k_{on}}{\underset{k_{off}}{\rightleftharpoons}} FS
    \end{displaymath}

    where $F$ represents freely diffusing proteins, $S$ represents immobile vacant
    binding sites, and $FS$ the complex between the two, when the protein is bound
    to the binding site. The value of \Kon{} and \Koff{},
    are estimated from the rate at which photobleached $F$ is replaced in the $FS$ complex.

    Ongoing development of FRAP has led to increasingly complex models
    that are both more precise and accurate than simple inverse exponential decay \addref{?}.
    Despite their sophistication, these models require assumptions
    that are difficult to maintain over long experimental observation times.
    Firstly, equilibrium must be maintained throughout the entire experiment 
    so that both \Kon{} and \Koff{} remain constant.
    This also requires that concentrations of both $F$ and $S$ remain constant.
    Secondly, distribution of the fluorescently tagged molecule must mimic the endogenous protein.
    And finally, the binding sites must be part of a large, relatively immobile complex
    on the time and length scale of the recovery.

  \subsection{FRAP measurements of histones}

    FRAP has been extensively used to obtain qualitative and quantitative
    insight on the kinetic properties of proteins, including histones \citep{KimuraCook}.
    These results show extremely slow recovery rates
    of histones with residency half-lives longer than 8~hours.

  \subsection{Aims}

    In order to observe the implications for nucleosome structure and function for
    the histone SIN mutant H4~R45H that exhibited the
    highest increase in nucleosome mobility \textit{in vitro}
    we attempted to determine its exchange characteristics by FRAP.
    To achieve quantitative measurements we addressed the multiple technical challenges 
    of measuring subtle kinetic alterations of the nucleosome dynamics 
    over long time periods in live cells. This allowed us to define 
    the limitations of FRAP in observing molecules with extremely slow exchange rates.
