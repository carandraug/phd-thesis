H2AX review - Structure and function of histone H2AX
====================================================

Where we review the literature on H2AX, the whole protein, instead of
the more common focus/obsession on É£-H2AX.  The original project,
measuring dynamics of mutant histone proteins, included H2AX which is
why we did this.  Alas, that project was a failure and we never got
to use this.  Still this appears as an appendix of the thesis.

This got published on on 2010 as a chapter of the book "Genome Stability
and Human Diseases" from the Subcellular Biochemistry series, volume 50.

The source for the original publication is available online on

The modifications done here are of style only, to fit with the rest
of the thesis.

At the time we wrote this, we didn't know any better so we generated
the figures manually.  We do not have scripts to generate them
automatically from the raw data.  Still, we make it available with
details on how it was analyzed (see subdirectory `data`).
