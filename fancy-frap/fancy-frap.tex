  \chapterprecis{%
    After failing miserably with measuring the effects of mutations
    in the histone dynamics, we tried to measure the dyanmics of
    the centromeric proteins with histone fold domains.
    We stepped up the game by performing FRAP and inverse FRAP at
    the same by using PA-GFP in tandem with mRuby (which we named
    Mary).  We got some nice preleminary results but then ran out
    of time.
