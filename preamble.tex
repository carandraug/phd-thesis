%% From Section 6 - The PhD Examination Process
%%
%% 6.2.3 Directions on Format, Layout and Presentation
%%
%% The PhD thesis should not normally exceed 80,000 words, inclusive
%% of appendices, footnotes, tables and bibliography.  It is
%% university policy that the practice of engaging professional
%% editorial services to assist in writing the thesis is not
%% permitted.  There must be a title page which shall contain the
%% following information:
%%
%%  a. The full title (and subtitle, if any)
%%  b. The volume number and total number of volumes, if more than one
%%  c. The full name of the candidate, followed, if desired, by any
%%     degree and/or professional qualification(s)
%%  d. The name(s) of the supervisor(s), School(s), component
%%     Discipline(s), Institution
%%  e. The month and year of submission.
%%
%% Format and Layout
%%
%% The 'Table of Contents', which should not be over-detailed, shall
%% immediately follow the title page.  The text must be printed on good
%% quality (110g/m2) A4 size paper.  Line-spacing should be a maximum
%% of one-and-half; text must be left justified with a left-hand
%% margin of 4 cm and may be right justified.  An easily-readable
%% layout and double-sided printing are recommended for the body text.
%% For double sided printing ensure that the right hand margin is also
%% adequate for binding (i.e. a margin of 4 cm).  More compact formats,
%% with smaller font sizes, are usually appropriate for certain
%% sections, such as reference lists, bibliographies and some kinds of
%% appendices.  Pages must be numbered consecutively, with page numbers
%% located centrally at the bottom, and chapter headers at the top, of
%% each page.  Diagrams, graphs, photographs and tables should be
%% properly numbered and located in relation to the text.  The copies
%% of the thesis presented initially for examination must be spiral or
%% gum-bound.
%%
%% This is pretty much repeated in Appendix 1 --- Regulations for
%% Higher Research Degrees, Section 10 Submission of the Thesis.
