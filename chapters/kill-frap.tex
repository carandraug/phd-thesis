\chapter{Quantitative dynamics of histones in the human cell nucleus}
\label{ch:frap}

  %% I decided to have a chapter precis. That is enough decorative
  %% test for the first page of a chapter.

  %% chapter concept: in this chapter goes the whole kill FRAP project. I started
  %% positive that this should work and so should the text. We start by studying
  %% the technique and list the assumptions it requires. We do one experiment and
  %% face some problems. Each problem has its own section that ends in a solution.
  %% When the solution was not done, we could offer one. The last one is the cause
  %% that this is not possible and has no solution. Conclusion lists all problems
  %% and their solutions again.

  \chapterprecis{
    To further the understanding of nucleosome structure and positioning
    in DNA, we aim to measure kinetic differences between wild type and
    mutant histones in live cells. Fluorescent Recovery After Photobleaching
    is a technique successfully used before to show the different kinetics and
    populations between different histone types. Using the same approach with
    our most disrupting histone mutant, we test the limits of FRAP when
    faced with extremely slow exchange ratios.
