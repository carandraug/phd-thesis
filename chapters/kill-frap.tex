  %% chapter concept: in this chapter goes the whole kill FRAP project. I started
  %% positive that this should work and so should the text. We start by studying
  %% the technique and list the assumptions it requires. We do one experiment and
  %% face some problems. Each problem has its own section that ends in a solution.
  %% When the solution was not done, we could offer one. The last one is the cause
  %% that this is not possible and has no solution. Conclusion lists all problems
  %% and their solutions again.

  %% FIXME 2nd year report
  %%My overall objective is to measure \textit{in vivo} the role of different nucleosome regions
  %%in chromatin dynamics. Based upon the workflow established in my first year, I aim to obtain
  %%the mathematical analysis knowledge that would enable examination of FRAP data and obtain
  %%accurate quantitative data. This defines a series of objectives:
  %%
  %%\begin{enumerate}
  %%  \item Create stable cell lines expressing a FP-tagged Sin$^{-}$ mutant;
  %%  \item Track cells moving during long time FRAP experiments;
  %%  \item Obtain recovery curves from FRAP experiments;
  %%  \item Measure kinetic properties from the recovery curves.
  %%\end{enumerate}
