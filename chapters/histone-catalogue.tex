%% "Honestly, we hacked most of it together with perl" -- God on the universe xkcd 224
%% "Some say the world will end in fire; some say in segfaults" -- xkcd 312

%% Chapter concept:
%%- Brief introduction
%%        - Gene annotation workflow
%%        - Gene nomenclature rules
%%        - Gene family cataloguing strategies
%%        - Timeline of histone nomenclature and main attempts to catalogue histones
%%        - Reproducible research concept
%%- Results will be generated manuscripts for human and mouse, possibly chicken
%%- More extensive Discussion covering
%%        - Level of change in families since Marzluff, and during your work
%%        - Amount of errors in public gene annotations, and process of getting them fixed
%%        - Server/script infrastructure required
%%        - Publication issues (versioning etc)
%%        - Limitations and risks to implementation breaking
%%
%% I will be reusing a lot of the text that was written for the manuscript
%% which we are trying to publish
