The source uses the document class svmult (SVMult), a class derived from
article.cls by Springer. Their style file can be downloaded from from their

For the formatting of the bibliography, we were instructed to use the harvard
style so we used that word for bibliographystyle. However, no harvard style file
was ever made available to us.

The images are in eps format as requested by the publisher. Original color images
(publication was also in black and white) and vector graphics are in the `figs'
directory.
