  %% TODO
  \todo[inline]{shouldn't I have a section where I describe the cloning of all the plasmids
                I made for this? There's Sin- mutants, histone variants, different colors...
                
                Also, how I created the stable cell lines, first by picking colonies and
                then using FACS to sort them. There's those nice plots from the sorting.
                
                Maybe I should split the methods into the methods chapters and materials
                chapeter.
                
                And the kill curve for selection of antbiotc concentration
                
                \textbf{Andrew notes:}
                
                Some ?is? methods. Easiest is to summarise in a table with 1-2 paragraphs descriptive
                of design + process. With FACS etc you need to show results to validate
                your reagents.}
