%% "Be the trouble you want to see in the world" -- A softer world
%% "Some say the world will end in fire; some say in segfaults" -- xkcd 312
%% "This is the emergency override system, which can be used to regain control of
%% the aircraft. Complete instructions for activating this system are available
%% as a GNU Info page." -- xkcd 912

%% if there's enough time, write a chapter on how the image package can be used
%% for image processing and microscopy, listing all the functions that I wrote
%% This would read like a small manual of the image package

\section{Image package}
  \subsection{data types}
    %% a lot of changes to support images of all data types (specially since
    %% microscope images are often uint16 and most code is just hardcoded uint8)

  \subsection{OME}
    %% also mention tiff_tag_read

    \subsubsection{BioFormats}
    \subsubsection{OMERO}
  \subsection{automatic threshold}
    %% so many new algorithms and possibility to pass the histogram directly
  \subsection{normxcorr2}

    %% I also pretty much rewrote the whole imhist which really needed. But
    %% how to write about it? Maybe a just a section about all other work?
    %% we also made imdilate and imerode work properly for non symmetrical SE

  \subsection{compatibility}

\section{CropReg}
\label{sec:cropreg}
\section{Frapinator}
\label{sec:frapinator}
  %% better move the code to af-lab github
\section{foci tracker for FancyFRAP}
