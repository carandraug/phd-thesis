    Chromatin is a dynamic complex that controls access to genetic information by
    undergoing structural reconfigurations. Understanding this dynamics can
    provide insights into the biological implications of chromatin organisation.

    We have undertaken a detailed catalogue of
    the human core histone genes and contributed to
    their annotations. Based on the reproducible research concept,
    we produced this
    catalogue in the format of a self-updatable manuscript
    as a model for similar projects
    which can be continually improved along with genome annotations.
    As proof of concept, we
    also implemented a catalogue of the current mouse
    histone genes by minimal adjustment of the code.

    Quantitative fluorescence microscopy has been used extensively to obtain insights
    into the dynamics of multiple proteins in live cells. Despite many advances in
    model design, fluorophores and imaging capabilities, limitations are still
    encountered that can lead to misinterpretation of data.
    By using histone proteins with extremely slow exchange rates we have tested the
    limitations of Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) and developed
    approaches to overcome some of them. Importantly, we show that movement of
    chromatin precludes measurements of histone dynamics on the FRAP time scale.

    To achieve these results we made contributions to multiple free
    software projects including Octave, BioPerl, and
    Debian.  This included implementing new algorithms, refactoring
    code for efficiency and consistency, adding new libraries,
    creating support tool plugins, and packaging software for ease of
    installation by users. A core theme of this work was to create
    build systems capable of processing primary data from public
    databases or microscopy in a completely transparent way to
    generate complete manuscripts as implementations of the
    reproducible research concept. This thesis itself is an example of
    the approach.

    In these studies we have tested the limits and developed new
    approaches to existing methods of chromatin analysis by designing
    novel reagents and software for the field of chromatin dynamics.
