%% Excerpt from Section 6 - The Examination Process
%%
%%  6.3 The Thesis
%%
%%  Norms as to the formats of research master’s and PhD theses vary. In general,
%%  thesis formats, structures and layouts that are consistent with readability and
%%  compactness are required. Acceptable formats and other attributes of Master
%%  and PhD theses are outlined in the University Regulations (Appendices 3 and 1,
%%  respectively) and may be specified in more detail in local guidelines.
%%  It is university policy that the practice of engaging professional editorial services
%%  is not permitted.
%%
%%  6.3.1 Length of Thesis
%%
%%  [...] The PhD thesis should not
%%  normally exceed 80,000 words, inclusive of appendices, footnotes, tables and
%%  bibliography.
%%
%% Excerpt from Appendix 1 - Regulations for Higher Research Degrees
%%
%%  Submission of the Thesis
%%
%%  10. The candidate must follow the directions on format, layout and presentation
%%      of a thesis, as described below. Two copies of the PhD thesis, spiral or gum-
%%      bound, must be lodged with the Examinations Office (unless otherwise
%%      stated). Each copy of the thesis must be accompanied by:
%%        a) a ‘Summary of the Contents’, not exceeding 300 words in length
%%        b) a copy of the completed form EOG 020.
%%        c) Library Submission Form, EOG 051 signed by the candidate
%%
%%      Directions on Format, Layout and Presentation
%%
%%      There must be a title page which shall contain the following information:
%%        a) The full title (and subtitle, if any)
%%        b) The volume number and total number of volumes, if more than one
%%        c) The full name of the candidate, followed, if desired, by any degree and/or
%%           professional qualification(s)
%%        d) The name(s) of the supervisor(s), school(s), component discipline(s),
%%           institution
%%        e) The month and year of submission.
%%
%%      Table of Contents
%%
%%      The ‘Table of Contents’, which should not be over-detailed, shall immediately
%%      follow the title page.
%%
%%      Format and Layout
%%
%%      The text must be printed on good quality (110g/m2) A4 size paper with a
%%      left-hand margin of 4 cm. A maximum of one-and-half line-spacing, left
%%      and right justified, an easily readable layout and double sided printing are
%%      recommended for the body text. More compact formats, with smaller font
%%      sizes, are usually appropriate for certain sections, such as reference lists,
%%      bibliographies and some kinds of appendices. Pages must be numbered
%%      consecutively, with page numbers located centrally at the bottom, and chapter
%%      headers at the top, of each page. Diagrams, graphs, photographs and tables
%%      should be properly numbered and located in relation to the text.

%% Does not account for the the histone cataloguing part. Plus there wasn't that much
%% study on the structure function relationships as it was mostly methods and things not

%%
