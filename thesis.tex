    Chromatin is a dynamic complex that controls access to genetic information by
    undergoing structural reconfigurations. Understanding this dynamics will give
    us a better insight into the biological implications of chromatin organization.

    Quantitative fluorescence microscopy has been used extensively to obtain insights
    into the dynamics of multiple proteins in live cells. Despite the large advances on
    model design, fluorophores and imaging capabilities, limitations are still
    encountered that can lead to misinterpretation of data.

    By using histone proteins with extremely slow exchanging rates we have tested the
    limitations of Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) and developed
    approaches to overcome some of them. Importantly, we have shown that movement of
    chromatin does not allow for measurements of histone dynamics on the FRAP time scale.

    By combining FRAP with a FRAP variant technique using photoactivatable proteins, we have
    set up a framework for a new model capable to simultaneously estimate both \Kon{}
    and \Koff{}. For this purpose we have tested the photoconvertible protein mEos2,
    and then constructed a new fluorescent protein combining PA--GFP with mRuby in tandem,
    to avoid the limitations of mEos2.

    Finally, we have undertaken a detailed catalogue of the human histone genes and completed
    their annotations. Based on the ``reproducible research'' concept, we made this
    catalogue not only a self-updatable paper, but also a model for similar projects
    which can be continually improved driven by genome annotations. As proof of concept, we
    are making a catalogue of the current mouse and chicken histone genes by minimal
    adjustment of the code we produced for the human homologues.

    In these studies we have tested the limits of several existing models by designing
    novel reagents, software and approaches in the field of chromatin dynamics.
