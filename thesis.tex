    Chromatin is a dynamic complex that controls access to genetic information by
    undergoing structural reconfigurations. Understanding this dynamics will
    provide insights into the biological implications of chromatin organisation.

    We have undertaken a detailed catalogue of
    the human core histone genes and contributed to
    their annotations. Based on the reproducible research concept,
    we produced this
    catalogue in the format of a self-updatable manuscript
    as a model for similar projects
    which can be continually improved driven by genome annotations.
    As proof of concept, we
    also implemented a catalogue of the current mouse
    histone genes by minimal adjustment of the code.

    Quantitative fluorescence microscopy has been used extensively to obtain insights
    into the dynamics of multiple proteins in live cells. Despite the large advances in
    model design, fluorophores and imaging capabilities, limitations are still
    encountered that can lead to misinterpretation of data.
    By using histone proteins with extremely slow exchanging rates we have tested the
    limitations of Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) and developed
    approaches to overcome some of them. Importantly, we have shown that movement of
    chromatin does not allow for measurements of histone dynamics on the FRAP time scale.

    \todo[inline]{3 sentences summarising software}

    In these studies we have tested the limits and developed new
    approaches to existing methods of chromatin analysis by designing
    novel reagents and software for the field of chromatin dynamics.
