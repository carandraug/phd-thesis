## NoShellCommand
##
## Do not involve the shell in the command.  Same syntax as the Command
## builder, but each element in "action" is one of the arguments for the
## final command.
##
## "target" and "source" are ignored by NoShellCommand and need to appear
## defined again in "action".  Use of $TARGET and $SOURCE is not supported
## (the whole point of this builder is to perform no escaping whatsoever).

## NoShellOutput
##
## Same as NoShellCommand with the difference that the output of "action"
## is redirected to "target"
