%%of our FRAP experiments. These have revealed significant challenges to the determination

\section{Chromatin organization}
  Chromatin is a dynamic complex that controls access to genetic information by
  undergoing reconfiguration of its structure. Since nucleosomes are the chromatin
  basic structural unit, their structural properties are on the basis of such reconfigurations.

\section{In vivo techniques for quantitative protein dynamics}
  \subsection{FRAP}

    Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an optical
    microscopy technique to measure the dynamics of fluorescently
    tagged molecules.
    Originally developed in the 1970's for quantitative dynamics of lipids
    in cell membrane under the name Fluorescence Photobleaching
    Recovery (FPR) \citep{axelrod1976mobility}, it has
    been extensively used to obtain qualitative and quantitative
    insight on the kinetic properties of proteins since the development
    of GFP tagging.
    From studies of X, Y, and Z, to I, J, and K, FRAP is an ubiquitous
    technique in the field of cell biology with continual reviews being
    published\addref{for all the reviews about it every year}.

    In this technique, fluorescently tagged molecules in a small region
    are photobleached.  The fluorescent intensity in the region is
    measured over time to obtain a recovery curve.  The recovery is a
    function of the molecule dynamics, it represents the unbleached
    molecules, from outside the bleached region, moving into the
    photobleached region.  The molecule dynamics is determined by the
    transport and diffusion rates, as well as binding interactions.

    In the simplest case, a FRAP recovery curve is analysed
    qualitatively.  By looking at the plotted data, one assesses
    whether recovery is fast or slow, presence of an immobile
    fraction and binding interactions, and how this changes
    between different cases \fref{fig:intro:frap-curve-example}.

    \begin{figure}

      \caption{}
      \label{fig:intro:frap-curve-example}
    \end{figure}

    In quantitate FRAP, data analysis involves fitting the recovery
    data to an idealized mathematical model.
    Many different models exist with different assumptions for the model
    \fref{fig:intro:frap-model-components}, and dependent on different
    parameters.
    Kinetic parameters are typically \Kon{} and \Koff{}, for
    binding and unbinding rate constants, and $D_{f}$ for diffusion constant.
    Different parameter values for the model are tested, until a curve is
    obtained that fits best to the measured recovery.

    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \missingfigure{table of different assumptions as in Macnally's 2010 review}
      \caption{blah blah blah, there's so many models, how can anyone trust
               any of this?}
      \label{fig:intro:frap-model-components}
    \end{figure}

    Two factors contribute for the widespread use of this technique:
    it doesn't require specialized instruments and can be performed with
    any standard confocal microscope or widefield microscope with a laser
    module; and recovery curves are easy to understand making it easy to
    identify artifacts.  This is not the case with alternative techniques
    such as FCS (Fluorescence Correlation Microscopy) or single molecule
    tracking.

    The technique however has implicit assumptions which are applicable
    for most biological situations:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The biological system has reached equilibrium and the equilibrium
        is maintained throughout the experiment, \ie{} the kinetic parameters
        must remain constant throughout the experiment;

      \item distribution of tagged protein mimics the endogenous protein;

      \item the binding sites are part of a large, relatively immobile
        complex, on the time and length scale of the recovery.
    \end{itemize}

    These assumptions become difficult to maintain as the experiment
    times increases, a requirement for slow moving molecules.  This
    is discussed again in \Cref{ch:kill-frap}.
