\section{Chromatin}

  %% Note that the size of an human genome is for an haploid genome.  The
  %% actual number of bp inside a typical cell will be double of that.
  %% Also, the estimate ignores mitochondrial DNA but at this scale its size
  %% is negligible anyway, and we are talking about fitting it into the
  %% nucleus anyway.
  The human genome has a length of some \num{3.2e9}
  base pairs long \citep{nature-first-human-genome-draft}
  meaning that a human cell will
  typically have \SI{6.4}{\giga\bp} of genomic information inside
  its nucleus.
  All of this is organised in a large DNA--protein complex known as chromatin.

  Access to the genomic information is not uniform in chromatin.
  It is organized in a hierarchical structure with
  multiple levels of compaction \frefp{fig:intro:chromatin-structure} where
  the level of compaction increases as access to the underlying genomic
  information decreases.
  One common view distinguishes
  euchromatin and heterochromatin for low and
  high compaction respectively.
  This binary distinction is associated with active and inactive genes
  since high level of compaction prevents DNA transcription by blocking
  the access of the required machinery\addref{}.
  Chromatin function is not limited by the compaction of DNA
  to fit into the cell nucleus.
  Instead, chromatin controls access
  to the DNA which means mediating transcription, replication,
  and recombination, as
  well as protecting DNA from damage; controlled and efficient
  access to genomic information is not simply a barrier problem for the sake
  of compaction \citep{controlling-double-helix}.

  The nucleosome is the
  basic repeating unit in the chromatin hierarchical structure.
  An array of nucleosomes is then folded into a chromatin fiber by
  short-range interactions between neighbouring nucleosomes
  and the subsequent interactions between chromatin fibers shape the
  condensed chromosome structure \frefp{fig:intro:chromatin-structure}.
  While the nucleosome
  structure is well established \citep{luger1997-28angstrom},
  details on the structure of the
  intermediary structures are still controversial and some recent models
  eschew them altogether
  \citep{fussner2011-no-30nm-fibre, luger2012-chromatin-review}.

  The nucleosome itself is composed of a core particle
  consisting of \SI{147}{\bp} of DNA and a histone protein octamer,
  and a variable length linker DNA that connects
  to the flanking core particles \frefp{fig:intro:nucleosome-top-view}.
  Altogether, the nucleosome includes \SIrange{165}{245}{\bp} of DNA
  \citep{widom1992-linker-length}.

  Nucleosomes act as the substrate for almost all nuclear processes that
  require access to genomic DNA \citep{controlling-double-helix}.
  Reconfigurations of local chromatin necessary for these processes can
  be accomplished by changing nucleosome structure, or altering its
  composition by incorporation of variant histones or post-translational
  modifications.
  Understanding chromatin structure and the nature of changes which can
  occur requires understanding the biochemical properties of nucleosomes
  \Srefp{sec:intro:chromatin-remodelling}.

  \subsection{Histones}

    Histones are a family of proteins that are the principal protein component
    of chromatin.
    There are five histone types: H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.
    Histone H1 binds to the linker DNA and is not part of the nucleosome.
    The other four histones form the core
    nucleosome and are therefore referred to as core histones.
    The DNA polymer is negatively charged and the highly
    basic histone proteins bind to it, neutralizing the negative charge
    and facilitating the required compaction of DNA.
    The histones interact with each other in a defined way to form
    a compact histone octamer structure that furthers
    DNA compaction.

    The histone octamer is the central component of the nucleosome core particle
    \frefp{fig:intro:nucleosome-top-view}
    composed of two of each of the core histones arranged in four dimers
    --- two H2A--H2B and two H3--H4.
    The two H3--H4 dimers form a disk-shaped (H3--H4)\textsubscript{2}
    tetramer at the centre \frefp{fig:intro:tetramer-side-view}
    with one H2A--H2B dimer on each face of the disk
    \frefp{fig:intro:octamer-side-view}
    and the \SI{147}{\bp} of DNA wrapped around in 1.65~turns
    \frefp{fig:intro:nucleosome-side-view}.

    \subsubsection{Histone and nucleosome structure}

      The linear organisation of the core histones proteins is divided
      into three parts: the histone fold domain --- the central piece of a
      histone involved in the formation of histone dimers, histone
      fold extensions, and the histone tails --- regions of the histone
      that extend beyond the nucleosome interacting with the DNA and
      other nucleosomes.

      %% Histone fold domain
      %% \textalpha1--L1--\textalpha2--L2--\textalpha3
      Core histone proteins share a common
      histone fold domain, which consists of a long central
      \textalpha-helix flanked on both sides by loops
      and shorter \textalpha-helices \citep{arents1991-31angstrom, arents1995histone-fold}.
      This domain allows for the characteristic ``handshake'' motif
      of dimer assembly where the central \textalpha-helix of each
      histone crosses each other and fits between the shorter
      \textalpha-helices of the other (\fref{fig:intro:h2a-h2b-structure}
      and \ref{fig:intro:h3-h4-structure}).
      This gives histones an extensive molecular contact interface
      between each other.

      \end{figure}

      %% Histone tails

      Each of the four core histones has an unstructured N and/or C
      terminal tail that extend beyond the DNA in the nucleosome core,
      making the inter-nucleosome interactions and therefore an important
      role on chromatin higher order structures.
      In addition, the tails are subject to a wide range of
      post-translational modifications
      including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation,
      and ADP--ribosylation \citep{bannister2011ptm-review}.
      The vast number of post-translational modifications has led to the
      histone code hypothesis that these modifications are the basis for
      regulation of chromatin-templated processes \citep{jenuwein200histone-code}.

      %% Should we mention that there are a few PTM in the nucleosome
      %% core, it's just that the vast majority are on the tails?

      Histone post-translational modifications have indeed been shown to
      regulate chromatin structure
      by recruiting different protein complexes.
      They have been show to influence
      DNA processes such as DNA replication, repair, recombination,
      and transcription.
      The most studied modifications have been related with transcription,
      gene activation and gene silencing in
      the original proposal for the histone code \citep{jenuwein200histone-code}
      reducing chromatin structure to an either ``on'' or ``off' state.
      For example,
      H3 K4 di-methylation and H3 K27 tri-methylation are well known
      markers for gene activation and silencing respectively.
      Similarly,
      phosphorylation of serine 139 H2AX is involved in DNA repair
      in the recruitment of DNA repair-related proteins \Srefp{app:h2ax-review}.

    \subsubsection{Histone variants}

      Each of the histones protein types is encoded by a large family
      of genes resulting in several slightly different proteins.
      These are grouped into two classes, canonical isoforms
      and variant histones, which are based on their gene location,
      expression characteristics, and functional roles.
      Canonical isoforms contribute to the majority
      of histones in chromatin, have high sequence identify, and display
      largely equivalent functions.  They are discussed in more detail on
      \Sref{section:histone-catalogue}.
      Variant histones are present in a smaller number than canonical
      histones, have more distinct sequences with unique structural features,
      and perform a variety of specialized functions.  For example, the
      H2A variant H2AX has a longer C-terminal tail with unique locations
      for post-translational modifications involved in DNA damage
      response \Arefp{app:h2ax-review}.  CENP-A is a H3 variant that
      forms a more compact and rigid nucleosome and has a unique N-terminal
      tail that is involved in centromere formation \citep{black2011-cenpa}.

    \subsubsection{Histone H1}
      %% I guess we should at least mention a bit of H1.

      %% Luger 1997 specifically says that H1 is part of the nucleosome.
      %% Other older papers also include H1 as part of the nucleosome
      %% structure.  That doesn't happen so often anymore.
      Histone H1 is not part of the nucleosome core particle and is not
      required for the beads on a string structure.
      Instead, it binds to the linker DNA
      to stabilise the higher order
      chromatin structures and modulate the accessibility of
      regulatory proteins,
      chromatin remodelling factors, and histone modification enzymes
      to their target sites.
      As with the case of higher order chromatin structures, details
      on H1 contribution to chromatin structure and function remains
      unclear but the typically accepted view is that it binds at
      the nucleosome DNA entry/exit points and that it shortens the
      length of the linker DNA bringing nucleosomes close together
      to form the \SI{30}{\nm} fibres \citep{harshman2013h1-review}.

      Similar to the canonical core histones, expression of histone H1 is
      replication dependent, there are variant H1 with specialised
      roles and tissue-specific expression, all canonical genes
      are located at a histone gene cluster, and the H1 protein
      is target to multiple post-translational modifications.
      Structuraly, histones H1 consist of a short N terminal, a globular
      structure, and a variable length C terminal with a high lysine
      content, which is why they are also named lysine-rich histones.

      There are fundamental differences in the functional roles of
      the core histones and histone H1.
      There is no sequence similarity between H1 and the core histones,
      histone H1 does not have a histone fold,
      histone H1 is not evolutionary conserved like core histones,
      and histone H1 is not required for nucleosome formation.
      ``Histon'' was the name given to the protein fraction of
      the original crude chromatin extracts \citep{kossel1884-histones}
      even though histone H1 was the first species to be separated from
      the others \citep{stedman1951main-histones-separation}.

    \subsubsection{Historical perspective on chromatin structure}
      %% History of study of the structure and function of chromatin.

      The first chromatin preparation \citep{kossel1884-histones}
      at the time named nucleïn, was
      separated in two components: one basic and protein-like which
      became known as histones, and one acid and unlike any cellular
      substance yet observed which became known as nucleic acid.
      This discovery was the precursor to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary
      molecule and genetic material, the discovery of DNA itself,
      the discovery of the nucleus as the recipient for genetic
      information, and even the discovery of proteins as polypeptides.

      The series of discoveries that led to the nucleosome
      structure form a timeline spanning over a century
      (\tref{tab:chromatin-discoveries-timeline},
      \cite{vanHolde-chapter1}).

            After a series of studies on chromatin chemical properties,
            including demonstration that nucleïn is negatively charged
            and histones positively charged, it was proposed that
            histone and DNA binding happens by electrostatic interactions.

\section{Fluorescence microscopy}

  Fluorescence microscopy is an essential tool
  for the visualization of cells and tissues.
  Fluoropores emit light in a specific wavelength after
  being exposed to another shorter wavelength, named
  emission and excitation wavelength respectively.
  Illumination of a sample with the excitation wavelength, and filtering
  out all but the emission wavelength allows
  the localization of fluorophores in a dark background.
  If specific molecules and cells can be associated with a fluorophore,
  their localization can be inferred.  By choosing fluorophores
  with different emission wavelengths multiple molecules can be
  simultaneously identified.

  \subsection{Fluorescent proteins}
    Several fluorescent labels have been developed with different
    properties, each best suited to different techniques.
    These are often split into two major classes:
    Synthetic fluorescent
    molecules such as DAPI or fluorescein, which either bind to the molecule of
    interest or can be chemically linked to it.
    These are added exogenously, which often requires cell
    fixation and permeabilization disturbing intracellular structures.
    In contrast, Fluorescent Proteins (FPs)
    are genetically encodable and can be expressed by the cells themselves.
    FPs allow tagging of individual molecules inside live cell, allowing
    visualization of dynamics in real-time live-cell imaging.
    %% TODO mention synthethic moleculus that bing to proteins with tag like snap
    %%      Over simplistic?  Fusion proteins for luciferase, etc

    The \species{Aequorea victoria} jellyfish
    Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was
    the first FP to be expressed recombinantly.
    Although originally discovered in 1962 \citep{shimomura1962-gfp-discovery},
    it was only in 1994 that it was used as a gene expression
    marker under the control of \gene{T7} and
    \gene{mec-7} promoters, in \species{E. coli} and \species{C. elegans}
    respectively \citep{gfp-first-expression-marker}.
    %% when was GFP first used as a gene tag?

    Since then, many GFP variants have been engineered by mutating its
    original nucleotide sequence.  These not only increase fluorescence
    quantum yield, photostability, and improved folding, but also change
    the excitation and emission spectrum, providing a wide range of GFP
    derivatives with different colours.  FPs in other organisms were also
    discovered and further engineered to provide further improved
    variants \citep{FP-color-palette}.

    An important class of FPs that have been developed are the
    photo-controllable FPs.
    These have
    fluorescent properties that can be controlled by excitation with specific
    wavelengths allowing for individual cells and proteins to be optically
    labeled making this proteins specially useful for studies of cell
    lineage and protein movement.
    They can be divided in three categories:

    \begin{description}
      \item[photo-activatable]
        Irreversible dark to bright state conversion.
        PA--GFP (Photo Activatable GFP), the first PA--FP to be
        reported, was developed by mutating the original GFP
        \citep{pagfp-discovery} and is
        still the only green PA--FP.
        It allows marking and tracking of a subset of molecules
        within cells.

      \item[photo-switchable]
        Irreversible conversion from one bright state to another bright
        state with a different emission wavelength.
        Like PA--FPs, they allow the tracking of
        molecules with the added advantages that the whole set is visible
        before the switch, and that the non-switched molecules continue
        to be visible.
        The development of proteins from this category started with Kaede FP
        which has an obligate homotetrameric
        complex \citep{kaede-discovery}, thus making it
        unsuitable for use as a genetically encoded fusion tag.
        Monomeric Kaede-like FPs have since been developed including
        mEos2 \citep{meos2-discovery}.

      \item[reversible photo-switchable]
        Reversible conversion between dark and bright states.
        These FPs, such as Dronpa, have mostly been used in
        single molecule localization
        microscopy, a type of super-resolution microscopy, due to the
        low energy required for the transition between states.
        %% We could mention RESOLFT but that would be too much detail.

    \end{description}


  \subsection{FRAP}

    Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an optical
    microscopy technique to measure the dynamics of fluorescently
    tagged molecules.
    Originally developed in the 1970 for quantitative dynamics of lipids
    in cell membrane under the name Fluorescence Photobleaching
    Recovery (FPR) \citep{axelrod1976mobility}, it has
    been extensively used to obtain qualitative and quantitative
    insight on the kinetic properties of proteins since the development
    of GFP tagging.

    FRAP is an ubiquitous technique in the field of cell biology,
    enabling a wide range of studies
    including cell membrane protein diffusion, dynamics of
    protein complex assembly, and protein aggregate degradation, to
    flow of drugs in extracellular matrices for drug delivery, fat
    migration in chocolate manufacturing, and plasticizers into food
    from packaging
    \citep{frap-review-2005,mcnally-frap-2010,frap-review-2015}.
    %% All the citations above are for reviews.  They made the most
    %% sense when I was trying to make/hide a point that writing about
    %% this was pointless because there's plenty of reviews out there,
    %% coming out every other year.

    In this technique, fluorescently tagged molecules in a small region
    are photobleached.  The fluorescent intensity in the region is
    measured over time to obtain a recovery curve.  The recovery is a
    function of the molecule dynamics of unbleached
    molecules from outside the bleached region moving into the
    photobleached region.  The molecule dynamics is dependent on the
    transport and diffusion rates, as well as binding interactions.

    In the simplest case, a FRAP recovery curve is analysed
    qualitatively.  By looking at the plotted data the qualitative
    recovery rate, presence of an immobile
    fraction and binding interactions, and how this changes
    between different cases can be interpreted
    \frefp{fig:intro:frap-curve-example}.

    \end{figure}

    In quantitate FRAP, data analysis involves fitting the recovery
    data to an idealized mathematical model.
    Many different models exist with different assumptions
    and dependence on
    parameters \citep{mcnally-frap-2010}.
    Kinetic parameters are typically \Kon{} and \Koff{}, for
    binding and unbinding rate constants, and $D_{f}$ for diffusion constant.

    A number of parameters go into the design of FRAP models.
    \begin{description}
    \item[compartment geometry] Are the boundaries of the compartment
      being considered at all or is it assumed to be an infinite space?
      Is the compartment a three dimensional volume or a two
      dimensional area only?
    \item[bleach event] Is the bleaching profile of the bleached
      region considered or is the bleaching assumed to be uniform?  Is
      the time duration of the bleaching event considered?  Is
      reversible photobleaching considered?
    \item[diffusion] Is molecular diffusion incorporated or are
      molecules movement assumed to be instantaneous?  Does it
      incorporate the different diffusion rates in a non-homogeneous
      compartment?
    \item[binding states] How many binding states, if any, are
      considered?  Are the binding states distributed equally within
      the compartment?
    \item[binding reaction] Is it modelled after a simple binding
      reaction, an sequence of reactions, or something more complex?
    \end{description}

    Two factors contribute for the widespread use of FRAP.
    Firstly, it does not require specialized instruments
    so it can be performed with
    any standard confocal microscope or widefield microscope with a laser
    module.
    Secondly, recovery curves are easy to understand making it easy to
    identify artifacts.  This is not the case with alternative techniques
    such as Fluorescence Correlation Microscopy (FCS) or single molecule
    tracking.

    FRAP has a number of implicit assumptions which are applicable
    for most biological situations.
    Firstly, the biological system is assumed to have
    reached equilibrium and the equilibrium
    is maintained throughout the experiment.
    This means the kinetic parameters
    must remain constant throughout the experiment.
    Secondly, the distribution of tagged protein mimics the endogenous
    protein.
    And finally, the binding sites for the recovering ligand
    are part of a large, relatively immobile
    complex, on the time and length scale of the recovery.
    These assumptions become difficult to maintain as the experiment
    times increases for slow moving molecules.
