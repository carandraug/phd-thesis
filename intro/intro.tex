\section{Chromatin}

  %% Note that the size of an human genome is for an haploid genome.  The
  %% actual number of bp inside a typical cell will be double of that.
  %% Also, the estimate ignores mitochondrial DNA but at this scale its size
  %% is negligible anyway, and we are talking about fitting it into the
  %% nucleus anyway.
  The human genome has a length of some \num{3.2e9}
  base pairs \citep{nature-first-human-genome-draft}
  meaning that a diploid human cell will
  typically have \SI{6.4}{\giga\bp} of genomic information inside
  its nucleus.
  All of this is organised in a large DNA--protein complex known as chromatin.

  Access to the genomic information is not uniform in chromatin.
  It is organized in a hierarchical structure with
  multiple levels of compaction \frefp{fig:intro:chromatin-structure} where
  the level of compaction increases as access to the underlying genomic
  information decreases.
  This is often simplistically distinguished as
  euchromatin and heterochromatin for low and
  high compaction respectively, although more detailed categories of
  chromatin spatial organisation have been proposed
  \citep{brehm2004colours, dixon2016chromatin-domains-review}.
  This binary distinction is in turn associated with active and inactive genes
  since a high level of compaction prevents DNA transcription by blocking
  the access of the required machinery \citep{ball2003portrait}.

  Chromatin function is not limited by the compaction of DNA
  to fit into the cell nucleus.
  Instead, chromatin controls access
  to the DNA by mediating transcription, replication,
  and recombination, as
  well as protecting DNA from damage.  Hence, controlled and efficient
  access to genomic information is not simply a barrier problem for the sake
  of compaction but involves chromatin structure as an active
  participant in genomic mechanisms \citep{controlling-double-helix}.

  The nucleosome is the
  basic repeating unit in the hierarchical structure of chromatin.
  An array of nucleosomes is then folded into a chromatin fiber by
  short-range interactions between neighbouring nucleosomes
  and the subsequent interactions between chromatin fibers shape the
  condensed chromosome structure \frefp{fig:intro:chromatin-structure}.
  While the nucleosome
  structure is well established \citep{luger1997-28angstrom},
  details on the structure of the
  intermediary assemblies are still controversial and some recent models
  eschew them altogether
  \citep{fussner2011-no-30nm-fibre, luger2012-chromatin-review}.

  The nucleosome itself is composed of a core particle
  consisting of \SI{147}{\bp} of DNA and a histone protein octamer,
  with a variable length linker DNA that connects
  flanking core particles \frefp{fig:intro:nucleosome-top-view}.
  Altogether the repeating nucleosome unit
  includes \SIrange{165}{245}{\bp} of DNA depending on species and
  cell type \citep{widom1992-linker-length}.

  Nucleosomes act as the substrate for almost all nuclear processes that
  require access to genomic DNA \citep{controlling-double-helix}.
  Reconfigurations of local chromatin necessary for these processes can
  be accomplished by changing nucleosome structure, or altering nucleosome
  composition by incorporation of variant histones or post-translational
  modifications.
  Understanding chromatin structure and the nature of changes which can
  occur during genomic activities
  requires understanding the biochemical properties of nucleosomes.

  \subsection{Histones}

    Histones are a family of proteins that are the principal protein components
    of chromatin.
    There are five histone types: H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.
    Histone H1 binds to the linker DNA and is not part of the
    nucleosome core particle.
    The other four histones form the core
    nucleosome and are therefore referred to as core histones.
    The DNA polymer is negatively charged and the highly
    basic histone proteins bind to it, neutralizing the negative charge
    and facilitating the required compaction of DNA.
    The histones interact with each other in a defined way to form
    a compact histone octamer structure that directs the
    DNA compaction.

    The histone octamer is the central component of the nucleosome core particle
    \frefp{fig:intro:nucleosome-top-view}.
    It is composed of two of each of the core histones arranged in four dimers
    --- two H2A--H2B and two H3--H4.
    The two H3--H4 dimers form a disk-shaped (H3--H4)\textsubscript{2}
    tetramer at the centre \frefp{fig:intro:tetramer-side-view}
    with one H2A--H2B dimer on each face of the disk
    \frefp{fig:intro:octamer-side-view}
    and the \SI{147}{\bp} of DNA wrapped around the octamer in 1.65~turns
    \frefp{fig:intro:nucleosome-side-view}.

    \subsubsection{Histone and nucleosome structure}

      The linear sequence of each core histone protein can be divided
      into three parts: The histone fold domain is the central and
      common to all four core histones.  It is
      involved in the formation of histone dimers and DNA binding.
      This is supplemented by histone fold extensions such as
      H3~\textalpha{}N helix and H2B~\textalpha{}C helix,
      and the histone tails which are regions of polypeptide
      that extend beyond the nucleosome to interact with DNA and
      other nucleosomes.

      %% Histone fold domain
      %% \textalpha1--L1--\textalpha2--L2--\textalpha3
      Core histone proteins share the common
      histone fold domain, which is comprised of a long central
      \textalpha-helix flanked on both sides by loops
      and shorter \textalpha-helices \citep{arents1991-31angstrom, arents1995histone-fold}.
      This domain provides the characteristic ``handshake'' motif
      of histone fold dimer assembly where the central \textalpha-helix of each
      histone crosses its dimeric partner and fits between the shorter
      \textalpha-helices of the other (\fref{fig:intro:h2a-h2b-structure}
      and \ref{fig:intro:h3-h4-structure}).
      This gives histones an extensive molecular contact interface
      within the dimer.

      %% Histone tails

      Each of the four core histones has unstructured N and/or C
      terminal tails that extend beyond the DNA in the nucleosome core,
      making the inter-nucleosome interactions and therefore
      playing an important
      role on chromatin higher order structures.
      In addition, the tails are subject to a wide range of
      post-translational modifications
      including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation,
      and ADP--ribosylation \citep{bannister2011ptm-review}.
      The vast number of post-translational modifications has led to the
      histone code hypothesis that these modifications are the basis for
      regulation of chromatin-templated processes \citep{jenuwein200histone-code}.

      %% Should we mention that there are a few PTM in the nucleosome
      %% core, it's just that the vast majority are on the tails?

      Histone post-translational modifications have indeed been shown to
      regulate chromatin structure
      by recruiting different protein complexes.
      This influences
      DNA processes such as DNA replication, repair, recombination,
      and transcription.
      The most studied modifications have been related with transcriptional
      gene activation and gene silencing as outlined in
      the original proposal for the histone code \citep{jenuwein200histone-code}
      that simplified chromatin structure
      effectively to either ``on'' or ``off'' state.
      For example,
      H3 K4 di-methylation and H3 K27 tri-methylation are well known
      markers for gene activation and silencing respectively.
      Similarly,
      phosphorylation of serene 139 in histone variant H2AX
      is involved in DNA repair
      in the recruitment of DNA repair-related proteins
      \citep{our-H2AX-review}.

    \subsubsection{Histone variants}

      Each of the histones protein types is encoded by a large family
      of genes resulting in several slightly different proteins.
      These are grouped into two classes, canonical isoforms
      and variant histones, which are based on their gene location,
      expression characteristics, and functional roles.
      Canonical isoforms contribute to the majority
      of histones in chromatin, have high sequence identify, and display
      largely equivalent functions as discussed in more detail on
      \Cref{ch:histone-catalogue}.
      Variant histones are present in a smaller number than canonical
      histones, have more distinct sequences with unique structural features,
      and perform a variety of specialized functions.  For example, the
      H2A variant H2AX has a longer C-terminal tail with unique locations
      for post-translational modifications involved in the DNA damage
      response.  CENP-A is a H3 variant that
      forms a nucleosome with altered biophysical properties
      and has a unique N-terminal
      tail that is involved in centromere identity \citep{black2011-cenpa}.

    \subsubsection{Histone H1}
      %% I guess we should at least mention a bit of H1.

      %% Luger 1997 specifically says that H1 is part of the nucleosome.
      %% Other older papers also include H1 as part of the nucleosome
      %% structure.  That doesn't happen so often anymore.
      Histone H1 is not part of the nucleosome core particle and is not
      required for the beads on a string structure.
      Instead, it binds to the linker DNA
      to stabilise the higher order
      chromatin structures and modulate the accessibility of
      regulatory proteins,
      chromatin remodelling factors, and histone modification enzymes
      to their target sites.
      Details
      of the contribution of H1 to chromatin structure and function remains
      unclear but the typically accepted view is that it binds at
      the nucleosome DNA entry/exit points and that it shortens the
      length of the linker DNA bringing nucleosomes close together
      to form the \SI{30}{\nm} fibres \citep{harshman2013h1-review}.

      Similar to the canonical core histones, expression of histone H1 is
      replication dependent with variant H1 isoforms having specialised
      roles and tissue-specific expression.  All canonical H1 genes
      are located in the main histone gene cluster on human
      chromosome 6, and the H1 protein
      is also the target of multiple post-translational modifications.
      Structuraly, histones H1 consist of a short N terminal, a globular
      structure, and a variable length C terminal with a high lysine
      content, which is why they are also named lysine-rich histones.

      ``Histon'' was the name given to the protein fraction of
      the original crude chromatin extracts \citep{kossel1884-histones}
      even though histone H1 was the first species to be separated from
      the others \citep{stedman1951main-histones-separation}.

      There are fundamental differences in the functional roles of
      the core histones and histone H1.
      There is no sequence similarity between H1 and the core histones,
      histone H1 does not have a histone fold,
      histone H1 is not evolutionary conserved like core histones,
      and histone H1 is not required for nucleosome formation.

    \subsubsection{Historical perspective on chromatin structure}
      %% History of study of the structure and function of chromatin.

      The first chromatin preparation \citep{kossel1884-histones}
      at the time named Nucleïn, was
      separated in two components: one basic and protein-like which
      became known as histones, and one acid and unlike any cellular
      substance yet observed which became known as nucleic acid.
      This discovery was the precursor to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary
      molecule and genetic material, the discovery of DNA itself,
      the discovery of the nucleus as the recipient for genetic
      information, and even the discovery of proteins as polypeptides.
      The series of advances that led to the nucleosome
      structure form a timeline spanning over a century
      (\tref{tab:chromatin-discoveries-timeline},
      \cite{vanHolde-chapter1}).

  \subsection{Chromatin Dynamics}
    Although there is no physical compartmentalization created by
    membranes as observed for cytoplasmic organelles, the chromatin within the
    nucleus appears highly organised with each individual chromosome
    occupying a distinct territory \citep{cremer2006chromosome}.
    Early studies of bulk chromatin dynamics, including experiments
    using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP),
    indicated that bulk chromatin in interphase was
    essentially immobile \citep{abney1997chromatin}.  Observation of
    labelled chromosome territories in live HeLa cells revealed no
    major mobility on the scale of individual chromosomes, with only small
    Brownian diffusion being recognised \citep{edelmann2001morphology}.
    Some authors
    described curvilinear movements of chromatin but they were
    attributed to nuclear rotation.  This apparent immobility was
    explained as chromatin attachment to subnuclear structures
    such as nucleolus and nuclear envelope, structural RNAs, and the
    nuclear matrix \citep{de1986curvilinear, parvinen1976chromosome}.

    However, increasing evidence indicates that chromatin motility is
    very complex and contains several levels of dynamic processes
    operating at different spacial scales and time frames
    \citep{hubner2010chromatin}.

    The yeast \species{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}
    centromeric chromatin movement is mainly caused by
    Brownian motion and it is restricted to a small nuclear volume.
    Crowding, entanglement and the presence of immobile structures
    such as microtubules seem to restrain the diffusion of centromeric
    chromatin \citep{marshall1997interphase}.  However, in contrast to
    centromeric and telomeric chromatin, internal chromosome mobility
    is dependent on the cell cycle. Noncentromeric chromatin is highly
    mobile including not only small-scale displacements
    ($<$\SI{0.2}{\micro\meter}) but also occasional large
    ($>$\SI{0.5}{\micro\meter}) displacements occurring in
    a time frame of seconds.
    The large movements are restricted in \G1 phase possibly due to
    crowding effects of a smaller nucleus.  The mobility is also
    reduced in S-phase and is speculated to be caused by chromatin
    attachment to nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope or
    internal nuclear structures \citep{heun2001chromosome}.

    Furthermore, transcriptional regulation has been shown to affect
    chromatin mobility.  Inactive loci generally found in the nuclear
    periphery are relocated to the interior of the nucleus upon
    activation.  For example, a locus that was transcriptionally active
    was shown to move towards the interior of the nucleus at
    \SIrange{0.1}{0.9}{\micro\meter\per\min} over
    \SIrange{1}{5}{\micro\meter} \citep{chuang2006long}.  Furthermore, inter
    and intra-chromosomal interactions in transcription complexes that
    co-regulate distal genes were shown to require loci movement
    towards these transcription factories \citep{osborne2004active}.
    Another example of motion is the contraction and looping of the
    \SI{655}{\kilo\bp} T cell receptor (TCR) beta loci to form close
    interactions with the TCR alpha--delta loci, during TCR
    recombination \citep{skok2007reversible}.

    A more recent study developed a new technique Displacement
    Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) for bulk chromatin dynamics and
    showned that chromatin movement is organised in large regions in the
    scale of \SIrange{4}{5}{\micro\meter} but that these are not
    chromosomal territories \citep{zidovska2013micron}.

    All these recent studies provide a more dynamic picture of the
    interphase chromatin than it was appreciated even a decade ago.

\section{Fluorescence microscopy}

  Fluorescence microscopy is an essential tool
  for the visualization of cells and tissues.
  Fluorophores emit light in a specific wavelength after
  being exposed to another shorter wavelengths, named
  emission and excitation wavelength respectively.
  Illumination of a sample with the excitation wavelength, and filtering
  out all but the emission wavelength allows
  the localization of fluorophores in a dark background.
  If specific molecules and cells can be associated with a fluorophore,
  their localization can be inferred.  By choosing fluorophores
  with different emission wavelengths multiple molecules can be
  simultaneously identified.

  \subsection{Fluorescent proteins}
    Several fluorescent labels have been developed with different
    properties suited to specific microscopy techniques.
    These are often split into two major classes:
    Synthetic fluorescent
    molecules such as DAPI or fluorescein, which either bind to the molecule of
    interest or can be chemically linked to it.
    These are added exogenously, which often requires cell
    fixation and permeabilization that can potentially
    disturb intracellular structures.
    In contrast, Fluorescent Proteins (FPs)
    are genetically encodable and can be expressed by the cells themselves.
    FPs allow tagging of individual molecules inside live cells, allowing
    visualization of dynamics by real-time live-cell imaging.
    %% TODO mention synthethic moleculus that bing to proteins with tag like snap
    %%      Over simplistic?  Fusion proteins for luciferase, etc

    The \species{Aequorea victoria} jellyfish
    Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was
    the first FP to be expressed recombinantly.
    Although originally discovered in 1962 \citep{shimomura1962-gfp-discovery},
    it was only in 1994 that it was used as a gene expression
    marker under the control of \gene{T7} and
    \gene{mec-7} promoters, in \species{E. coli} and \species{C. elegans}
    respectively \citep{gfp-first-expression-marker}.
    Since then many GFP variants have been engineered by mutating the
    original nucleotide sequence.  These not only increase fluorescence
    quantum yield, photostability, and improved folding, but also change
    the excitation and emission spectrum, providing a wide range of GFP
    derivatives with different colours.  FPs in other organisms were also
    discovered and further engineered to provide improved
    variants and wider range of fluorescent wavelengths
    \citep{FP-color-palette}.

    An important class of FPs that have been developed are the
    photo-controllable FPs.
    These have
    fluorescent properties that can be modulated by excitation with specific
    wavelengths allowing for individual cells and proteins to be optically
    labeled.  This strategy is specially useful for studies of cell
    lineage and protein movement.
    The photocontrollable FPs can be divided in three categories.

    %% Turns out that we not allowed to have a list of descriptions,
    %% or any list of any sort for that matter, so we must write this
    %% as normal paragraphs.

    Photo-activatable FPs undergo
        irreversible dark to bright state conversion.
        PA--GFP (Photo Activatable GFP), the first PA--FP to be
        reported, was developed by mutating the original GFP
        \citep{pagfp-discovery} and is
        still the only green PA--FP.
        It allows simple marking and tracking of subsets of molecules
        within cells.

    Photo-switchable FPs undergo
        irreversible conversion from one bright state to another bright
        state with a different emission wavelength.
        Like PA--FPs, they allow the tracking of
        molecules with the added advantages that the whole set is visible
        before the switch, and that the non-switched molecules continue
        to be visible.
        The development of proteins from this category started with Kaede FP
        which has an obligate homotetrameric
        complex \citep{kaede-discovery}, thus making it
        unsuitable for use as a genetically encoded fusion tag.
        Monomeric Kaede-like FPs have since been developed including
        mEos2 \citep{meos2-discovery}.

    Reversible photo-switchable FPs undergo
        interchangeable conversion between dark and bright states.
        These FPs, such as Dronpa, have mostly been used in
        single molecule localization
        microscopy, a type of super-resolution microscopy, due to the
        low energy required for the transition between states.
        %% We could mention RESOLFT but that would be too much detail.

  \subsection{FRAP}

    Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an optical
    microscopy technique to measure the dynamics of fluorescently
    tagged molecules.
    Originally developed in the 1970s for quantitative dynamics of lipids
    in cell membrane under the name Fluorescence Photobleaching
    Recovery (FPR) \citep{axelrod1976mobility}, it has
    been extensively used to obtain qualitative and quantitative
    insight into the kinetic properties of proteins when combined with
    the development
    of GFP tagging.

    FRAP is an ubiquitous technique in the field of cell biology,
    enabling a wide range of studies
    including cell membrane protein diffusion, dynamics of
    protein complex assembly, and protein aggregate degradation, to
    flow of drugs in extracellular matrices for drug delivery, fat
    migration in chocolate manufacturing, and plasticizers into food
    from packaging
    \citep{frap-review-2005,mcnally-frap-2010,frap-review-2015}.
    %% All the citations above are for reviews.  They made the most
    %% sense when I was trying to make/hide a point that writing about
    %% this was pointless because there's plenty of reviews out there,
    %% coming out every other year.

    In this technique, fluorescently tagged molecules in a small region
    are photobleached.  The fluorescent intensity in the region is
    measured over time to obtain a recovery curve.  The recovery is a
    function of the molecule dynamics of unbleached
    molecules from outside the bleached region moving into the
    photobleached region.  The molecule dynamics is dependent on the
    transport and diffusion rates, as well as binding interactions.

    Two factors contribute for the widespread use of FRAP.
    Firstly, it does not require specialized instruments
    so it can be performed with
    any standard confocal microscope or widefield microscope with a laser
    module.
    Secondly, recovery curves are easy to understand making it easy to
    identify artifacts.  This is not the case with alternative techniques
    such as Fluorescence Correlation Microscopy (FCS) or single molecule
    tracking.

    In the simplest case, a FRAP recovery curve can be analysed
    qualitatively.  Using the plotted data of the qualitative
    recovery rate, the presence of an immobile
    fraction and binding interactions and how this changes
    between different cases can be interpreted
    \frefp{fig:intro:frap-curve-example}.

      \label{fig:intro:frap-curve-example}
    \end{figure}

    In quantitative FRAP, data analysis involves fitting the recovery
    data to an idealized mathematical model.
    Many different models exist with different assumptions
    and dependencies on
    parameters \citep{mcnally-frap-2010}.
    Kinetic parameters are typically \Kon{} and \Koff{}, for
    binding and unbinding rate constants, and $D_{f}$ for diffusion
    constant
    although a variety of parameters can be included in
    the design of FRAP models \citep{mcnally-frap-2010}.

    The compartment geometry must be considered.  This includes
    deciding whether there are boundaries to the compartment or
    whether it is an infinite space.  A simplification of the
    compartment from a three dimensional volume to a two dimensional
    area can be applied.

    The bleaching event is a source of considerable variability.
    The time interval between the bleaching and the acquisition of the
    first image is a window where recovery of a mobile fraction might
    happen.  Likewise, the bleaching event is not
    instantaneous and will occur while molecules are exchanging.
    The shape of the bleached area is a parameter and the
    profile of the laser beam will also have an effect that can be modelled
    either as gaussian or flat-top distribution.

    Diffusion rates may be fixed, fitted, or assumed to be instantaneous.
    A single diffusion rate may be assumed for the whole
    compartment, or non-homogeneous regions in the compartment
    can have different diffusion rates.

    Finally, the binding also has a plethora of potential parameters.  Multiple
    binding states may be present when binding reactions occur in a
    series of steps involving multiple proteins.  The distribution of
    the binding sites may be not equal throughout the compartment.

    While all these may features may appear
    as parameters on the mathematical model for
    fitting, they also affect how the experiment is performed.

    FRAP has a number of implicit assumptions which are applicable
    for most biological situations.
    Firstly, the biological system is assumed to have
    reached equilibrium and the equilibrium
    is maintained throughout the experiment.
    This means the kinetic parameters
    must remain constant throughout the experiment.
    Secondly, the distribution of the tagged protein mimics the endogenous
    protein.
    And finally, the binding sites for the recovering ligand
    are part of a large, relatively immobile
    complex on the time and length scale of the recovery.
    These assumptions become difficult to maintain as the experiment
    times increases for slow moving molecules.

\section{Bioinformatics}
  \todo[inline]{Needs references!}

  Computers have become an essential tool in all areas of biological
  research.  With the advent of genomics and transcriptomics
  sequencing, and with development of super resolution microscopy,
  several gigabytes of data are easily generated daily in a lab.  The
  analysis of such amounts of data has become the bottleneck for
  research advances.  In this context, computers have become an
  essential tool, and a researcher will use a computer in a daily
  basis as an enabling device for their research.
  DNA sequences are computer files to be analysed by specialised
  software.  They are searched and compared by computers in large
  databases of other sequences.
  Likewise, structures of biomolecules are visualised
  in 3D in computers, and the prediction of structures is also done by
  computers.  Microscope images are visualised in the computer, and
  many microscopes now do not have an eye pieces.  Even
  the literature review is performed in a computer, new publications
  are searched in such databases rather than
  by browsing issues in libraries.  Software is
  thus essential for science and is a daily tool of the scientist.

  \todo[inline]{Say how despite this ubiquity, most researchers pay
      little attention to the development of software or its
      improvements to facilitate their efficiency and insights.}

  \subsection{Free Software and Scientific Advances}
  Scientific discoveries are almost always incremental on previous work.
  This is true not only for new hypotheses but also
  for methods.  New techniques are usually
  a constant iteration of improvements.  Software used by
  scientists is also a tool and therefore should allow for the same
  series of iterative improvements.
  Unfortunately, this often is not the case because
  many studies are published without the primary programme code.

  This has also been identified as a problem outside of academia.
  Multiple organisations exist to promote the ability of users of software
  to be free to modify the software of they use so it works for their
  purposes.  Two of the main proponents of this philosophy
  are the Free Software Foundation and the
  Open Source Initiative.  The Free Software Foundation defines free
  software as having four basic freedoms: freedom to study the
  code, freedom to modify the code, freedom to distribute the program,
  and free to distribute modified versions of the program.  This
  movement started in academia itself when a a research lab in MIT
  formed a company on the basis of their work, and used copyright to
  prevent improvement and sharing of the programs by the community.
  This led to the invention of copyleft, which is defined as
  the use of copyright law to
  ensure that software remains free.

  \subsection{Meta-research}

  The lack of sharing of computer code has an additional issue beyond delaying
  research by obliging researchers to redo the work of others or
  preventing them from adapting it.  It
  also delays progress because it makes difficult for other researchers to
  validate the original work by reproducing the published experiments.  This
  reproducibility has become an issue in recent years and multiple
  studies have identified that only a small number of findings may be
  reproducible as published.  This does not mean that results have
  been fabricated.
  In the majority of the cases, authors are
  unable to provide the necessary data, protocols, or code.
  In the small number of cases where the authors
  were able to give the code and data, results are not reproducible,
  often due to the complications of reproducing a runtime environment.

  One reason for this difficulty is that
  scientists are not usually expected to describe
  the software they used in a level of detail that would allow
  their colleagues to repeat or improve on their work.
  One reason for this anomaly is that
  scientists sharing their work through print-centred articles
  and books that are far from ideal media to share complicated source
  code, algorithms or procedural instructions.

  There is a growing
  interest within the scientific community to change the state.  Funding
  bodies such the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
  as well as some universities hosting research have issued
  requirements or made requests
  that code from publications should be openly shared.
  Likewise, journals have been
  changing their policies to promote code sharing. As an example,
  journal of open source software creating platforms for giving credit
  to software development\todo{?}.  Furthermore, code hosting
  providers such as github and bitbucket
  are increasingly used by scientists.
  %Ironically, these platforms are not free software themselves.

  This growing openness and sharing of code to enable incremental
  development of scientific software is becoming recognised as an
  important driver of progress in data driven fields.

  \subsection{Free Software Projects in Academia}
  Free software is used widely in academia, and many projects exist
  for enabling data analysis in molecular cell biology.
  BioPerl is a large project for the handling of biological
  data in the Perl programming language and was heavily involved in
  facilitating the sequencing of the human genome.  Similar projects have been
  created for the Python and Java languages, BioPython and BioJava.  Many
  programming languages used by bioscience researchers are themselves
  free software, including R, GNU
  Octave, and Julia.  Similarly, interactive applications have been
  created for less computationally literate users such as
  ImageJ for image analysis,  GBrowse for
  annotation and browsing genomic data, and OMERO for data storage.

    %%   having no charge or monetary cost, the free in ``free beer''.
    %%   The Portuguese language has both ``livre'' and ``gratis'' for
    %%   the two meanings of the English word ``free'', as do many other
    %%   languages.  This ambiguity becomes an issue in the topic of
    %%   software freedom since the expression ``free software'' can be

\section{Aims and Objectives}

  Histones organise the fundamental level of chromatin and
  although the static structure of histone-containing nucleosomes is
  known, their dynamic properties are poorly understood.  Current
  models of nucleosome dynamics are largely based on \textit{in vitro}
  experiments and yeast.  We wished to apply FRAP to test
  models of nucleosome dynamics in human cells and their dependence on
  amino acid variations in histones.

  While canonical core histones are usually referred to as single
  proteins by their type H2A, H2B,
  H3, or H4 only, they actually comprise a family of genes whose
  sequence differences are rarely recognised.
  We required a catalogue of the human histones to understand their
  sequence variation as a basis for the FRAP investigation
  but the last version of such inventory had been performed in
  2002, before the finalisation of the human genome \citep{Marzluff02}.
  Therefore, we assembled an up to
  date catalogue of all human core histones presented in
  \Cref{ch:histone-catalogue}.  Recognising the inevitable
  changes of such catalogues, we automated its creation so that a
  constantly up to date version could be generated with little effort.

  As a first attempt to apply FRAP as a tool for measuring the effect of
  histone sequences on mobility in cell nuclei we chose to investigate
  the stability of core histone SIN mutations.
  We faced complications
  of long time frame FRAP measurements.  In \Cref{ch:kill-frap} we detail our
  step-wise approach at solving these issues.

  Throughout this studies, we developed many software components and
  strove to improve existing tools that would be available to all
  researchers.  In \Cref{ch:software} we describe the multiple tools
  created and improved, all of which have been released under a free
  software licence.

  Inspired by the principles of reproducible research, all the source
  for this thesis is also available with a system to automate its
  construction from the raw data.  This thesis is itself part of our
  broader project to investigate
  the use of software development tools for the maintenance of
  reproducible research projects.
