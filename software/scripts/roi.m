## This is a piece of code adapted from the FRAPINATOR program, see
## https://github.com/af-lab/frapinator , only meant to generate
## the images for the thesis, since we want some additional formatting
## for style purposes only.

## While any file should work fine, the image we used for the thesis was
##
##        Location8Cell1
##
## from the dataset
##
##        2010-04-28 H4 R45H (11h after mitosis) 20px circle and 30ms scan and laser 7 2500frames

## This was one of the images collected at NIH in a Zeiss 510.  We kept
## the original lsm files so more details of the system can be found
## in the metadata of the file.
