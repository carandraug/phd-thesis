Figures NOT in chapters
=======================

Figures for most chapters will be on those chapters subdirectories,
e.g., `histone-catalogue/figs` or `kill-frap/figs`.  Also note that
most figures are generated as part of the build in which case they
are considered results.  Therefore, they will appear on that chapter
results subdirectory, .e.g, `kill-frap/results`.
