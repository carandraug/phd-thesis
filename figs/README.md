Figures that are not generated automatically
============================================

Note that most of the figures in the results chapter do not appear here. They
are considered the results and therefore will appear on the results directory.
But they are not in the repository either. They will be generated automatically
as part of the build process using the code in the source directory and the
raw data from the data directory.

The only figures that appear here is the rest, schematics, diagrams, logos, etc.
And even then, some are written in LaTeX itself.

* `facs-stable-cell-lines.pdf` unfortunately, this one had to be generated
this ways from the data. See the README.md in the data directory for details.

* `NUI_Galway_BrandMark_B.eps` the NUIG logo downloaded from the NUIG
[Brand identity rules](http://www.nuigalway.ie/vp/siea/internal/corp.html).
